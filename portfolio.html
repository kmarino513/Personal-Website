          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            The CRT website was creating using Next.js, a react framework. This
            framework was chosen mainly for optimization and features that will
            be used in the upcoming admin side of the website.
          </p>
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>This website has three primary purposes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              To showcase the team members, past and current rockets, and the
              team's sponsors
            </li>
            <li>To encourage other students to join the team</li>
            <li>
              To provide these potential applicants with information about the
              team and how to apply to join.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            These three goals are present in all the design aspects of the
            website The website homepage's centerpiece is a scroll-based
            animation of one of CRT's rockets. This design was inspired by
            Apple's AirPod Pro website which features a similar scroll based
            animation of the AirPods. The animation on both websites generates
            viewer interest and entices them to continue exploring the website.
            It also provides the opportunity to include a high-detail view of
            one of the team's rockets and also an overview of the team's
            composition and accomplishments. Many of the other Cornell project
            teams share similar website designs. Although in their own way they
            are each well-designed, CRT's unique design distinguishes itself
            from the other teams.

        <div>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            Coding Cabin was created using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
            backend utilizes Firebase for user authentication and the
            functionality behind the real-time collaboration and code-running.
          </p>

          <h3>Design</h3>

          <h4>Homepage</h4>
          <p>
            The inspiration for the homepage was the official website for the
            video game Firewatch (<a
              href="https://www.firewatchgame.com/"
              target="_blank"
            >
              https://www.firewatchgame.com/
            </a>
            ). The website features a stacked 3D parallax effect that creates
            depth on a 2D plane. I created a similar effect with vector artwork
            of a forest and mountains. Coding Cabin's homepage can also change
            between a night time and evening theme with the sun and moon buttons
            shown in the navigation bar. This inclusion was initially intended
            to act as a site-wide light/dark mode switch, but it was never fully
            implemented.
          </p>

          <h4>Logo</h4>
          <p>
            The logo for Coding Cabin also has a reference to programming as
            well. The cabin in the logo created by the less than and equal
            symbols (&lt;=) is also commonly used in programming languages as
            the "less than or equal to" Boolean operator.
          </p>

          <h4>Collaborative Coding Terminal</h4>

          <p>
            Coding Cabin's collaborative coding terminal was designed to
            replicate a typical coding experience in a text editor or IDE with
            the addition of enabling real-time collaboration. The coding area
            itself was designed to create a similar collaborative experience
            like that of Google Docs. In my experience, Google Docs offers one
            of the most seamless and efficient real-time collaboration
            experience, and as such, I designed the Coding Cabin collaborative
            coding terminal to share similar fluidity. The coding area also has
            syntax highlighting for Python and a light/dark mode switch,
            allowing users to choose their desired theme. The terminal portion
            was created following the design of a typical command prompt or UNIX
            shell. Overall, Coding Cabin's collaborative coding tool focuses on
            simplicity and allowing users to start coding quickly with any need
            for setup or prior experience.

        <div>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            The STEM & Buds website was created using Gatsby, a React-based
            static site generation framework. I chose Gatsby because the
            website's content is all static, and Gatsby offers extremely useful
            tools for static website creation such as static queries and
            performant, responsive images. Gatbsy's static queries were
            especially useful for the repetitive, similarly structured content
            such as the list of 60+ chapters on the website. Information for the
            chapters is stored in a JSON file, and using GraphQL and the static
            queries, the list of chapters is populated when the website is
            built. This feature was used in other areas of the website as well,
            but it was especially useful for the chapters.
          </p>

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            The target audience for this website is elementary/middle school
            aged students and their parents. Because of this, it was important
            to create a design that was both visually appealing, but also not
            overly distracting. The simple blue and green color scheme matches
            the organizations logo, and these two colors are repeated throughout
            the website. Alternating these colors creates a cohesive theme while
            maintaining readability and creating a pattern that is not
            distracting to users.
