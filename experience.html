      <h2>Agile Framework</h2>

            In my internship, I was able to learn how to properly organize and manage software-based projects using Agile framework. I was able to 
            experience first-hand all of thecollaboration and efforts from various teams and fields involved in the project, which allowed me to 
            interact with individuals of varying professions and specialties. In order to utilize this methodology, I held daily meetings to meet with
            the team, and ensured that we were making progress based on our sprint goals and coordinated problem-solving of any bugs.

      <h2>JIRA</h2>
      <section class="flex">
        <div>
          <p>
            I was also able to gain experience working with JIRA. I was able to experience how teams use this to maintain the flow of the
            project, and I was even able to lead daily meetings and follow up on issues that arose. This honed my skills in interacting with other
            team members as well as relaying information in an effective and concise manner. Specifically, I held end-of sprint meetings, where I
            utilized my knowledge of Agile to gain feedback for the team. Additionally, I used JIRAs en-of-sprint reporting mechanisms to create
            reports for upper management. Although I cannot show them here, these reports tracked current bugs, showed the progress in relation to
            our sprint goals, and detailed the future of the projects.

      <h2>Python</h2>
      <section class="flex">

            In my collegiate career, I have worked extensively with Python code, utilizing it for data analysis as well as with simulation.
            Here, I will discuss a project that I worked on in a simulation analysis and modeling course. The project required us to find an
            optimal solution to a problem where hospitals had to be placed across a large area of upstate New York. The goal was to minimize the 
            amount of time that patients would be transported via helicopter to a hospital. We made use of object oriented programming, along 
            with data provided to us from helicopter transports, in order to model the best solution. The code can be found

      <h2>Tableau</h2>
      <section class="flex">
        <div>
          <img text-align="left"
            src="Images/Tableau HW6 Q1.png"

          <p align="left">
            Additionally, I have worked extensively with Tableau in order to display data in an efficient manner. Here you can see Tableau outputs
            from an assignment that I completed in my machine learning tools course. This assignment required us to use the data given to us to
            show how a company can maximize sales. Specifically, I was able to create various displays in order to effectively analyze the problem
            at hand. Specifically, one of the displays I made was a map of the southern US which displays the sales value of various locations. As
            shown, the locations by state are displayed in different colors, and larger circles show greater sales value, allowing us to see that
            Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina have the highest sales value by state. Additionally, I created a line graph that displays the
            sales quantity by order type. The two order types shown are replenishment reorders (RR) and expedited orders (EO). The use of this chart
            is to show the relationship between the two orders, as shown with the similar patterns across the time horizon.
