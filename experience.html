            Agile framework is a methodology that is used for large software development projects. In my internship, I was able to learn 
            how to properly organize and manage software-based projects using this method. I was able to experience first-hand all of the
            collaboration and efforts from various teams and fields involved in the project, which allowed me to interact with individuals
            of varying professions and specialties. This provided me with direct insight to all of the facets of a software project. The
            main benefit of Agile framework is the ability of the team to adapt and make adjustments throughout the production process. Work
            is broken down into time periods called sprints, where work is done, and re-evaluation of the project can take place. Thus, seeing
            this in action allowed me to experience both the technical as well as the interpersonal challenges that teams face. Problem-solving
            is a large portion of what a project manager does, and I learned how to identify and properly fix such issues within an Agile framework.
