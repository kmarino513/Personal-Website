      <h2>Agile Framework</h2>

            Agile framework is a methodology that is used for large software development projects. In my internship, I was able to learn 
            how to properly organize and manage software-based projects using this method. I was able to experience first-hand all of the
            collaboration and efforts from various teams and fields involved in the project, which allowed me to interact with individuals
            of varying professions and specialties. This provided me with direct insight to all of the facets of a software project. The
            main benefit of Agile framework is the ability of the team to adapt and make adjustments throughout the production process. Work
            is broken down into time periods called sprints, where work is done, and re-evaluation of the project can take place. Thus, seeing
            this in action allowed me to experience both the technical as well as the interpersonal challenges that teams face. Problem-solving
            is a large portion of what a project manager does, and I learned how to identify and properly fix such issues within an Agile framework.

      <h2>JIRA</h2>
      <section class="flex">
        <div>
          <p>
            I was also able to gain experience working with JIRA, which is a tool used to help manage and organize work. This tool kept track of
            all progress, any issues, and long-term plans for the project. I was able to experience how teams use this to maintain the flow of the
            project, and I was even able to lead daily meetings and follow up on issues that arose. This honed my skills in interacting with other
            team members as well as relaying information in an effective and concise manner. I was able to utilize the many useful tracking mechanisms
            that JIRA offers, specifically the importance of using story points as an effective way to ensure that work gets done in a consistent way
            across sprints.

            Additionally, I learned how to properly utilize JIRA's end-of-sprint reports, such as burndown charts and sprint reports. I was able to
            utilize these to host meetings and discuss progress, as well as create reports to send to upper management. I was able to learn how to
            effectively convey metrics to the team, as well as deliver information to upper management in a concise way.
