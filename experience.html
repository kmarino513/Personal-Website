      <h2>Agile Framework</h2>
      <section class="flex">
        <div>
          <p>
            In my internship, I was able to learn how to properly organize and manage software-based projects using Agile framework. I was able to 
            experience first-hand all of thecollaboration and efforts from various teams and fields involved in the project, which allowed me to 
            interact with individuals of varying professions and specialties. In order to utilize this methodology, I held daily meetings to meet with
            the team, and ensured that we were making progress based on our sprint goals and coordinated problem-solving of any bugs.

      <h2>JIRA</h2>
      <section class="flex">
        <div>
          <p>
            I was also able to gain experience working with JIRA. I was able to experience how teams use this to maintain the flow of the
            project, and I was even able to lead daily meetings and follow up on issues that arose. This honed my skills in interacting with other
            team members as well as relaying information in an effective and concise manner. Specifically, I held end-of sprint meetings, where I
            utilized my knowledge of Agile to gain feedback for the team. Additionally, I used JIRAs en-of-sprint reporting mechanisms to create
            reports for upper management. Although I cannot show them here, these reports tracked current bugs, showed the progress in relation to
            our sprint goals, and detailed the future of the projects.

      <h2>Python</h2>

            In my collegiate career, I have worked extensively with Python code, utilizing it for data analysis as well as with simulation.
            Here, I will discuss a project that I worked on in a simulation analysis and modeling course. The project required us to find an
            optimal solution to a problem where hospitals had to be placed across a large area of upstate New York. The goal was to minimize the 
            amount of time that patients would be transported via helicopter to a hospital. We made use of object oriented programming, along 
            with data provided to us from helicopter transports, in order to model the best solution. The code can be found

            Additionally, I have worked extensively with Tableau in order to display data in an efficient manner.
